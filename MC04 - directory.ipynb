    "Media Cloud: Sources and Collections\n",
    "====================================\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you should be ready to query Media Cloud for data. **This notebook demonstrates how to browse and download information about the media sources and collections within Media Cloud Directory**. This explores some of the API methods under the hood of our [Directory](https://search.mediacloud.org/directory), which is used to browse sources and collections in our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every open web news story is connected to a `media source`. A media source is basically a domain (with a handful of exceptions). Sources are grouped together into `collections`; one source can be part of many collections, and vice versa. Our primary collections are [geography-based](https://search.mediacloud.org/collections/news/geographic) (at the national and provider/state level).\n",
    "\n",
    "We regularly scrape RSS feeds from a small set of our sources (around 60k as of late 2023). We are slowly rolling out the ability to ingest stories from news stories via their sitemap files (the hard part is determining which URLs arenews story pages and what are not). We don't advise searching against our entire database, without collections or sources, because it is skewed towards the topics of investigations we and collaborating researchers have done. If you have a collection you want created, just email us and ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Python API exposes a few methods that are particularly helpful for looking at sources, their associated metadata, and collections: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `collection_list`: search for collections by name\n",
    "* `source_list`: search for sources by name of parent collection\n",
    "* `source`: get information about specific source, by id\n",
    "* `feed_list`: list feeds within a source"
