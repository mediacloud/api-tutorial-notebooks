Media Cloud Online News Archive API Tutorial Notebooks
======================================================

A set up Python3 Jupyter notebooks for learning to use the Media Cloud API to investigate media coverage online. These are
tailored to be used with a hosted Jupyter Lab environment on [Bindery](https://mybinder.org/). 

## Hosted Quickstart

For quickly testing this out, we recommend launching this repo directly in Binder. Click this button to build and launch

## Run on Your Own Machine.

If you want to use these on your local machine:

1. Install Python 3.x
2. Setup Jupyter Notebooks (if you are new try [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) with [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html))
3. [Sign up for a Media Cloud account](https://search.mediacloud.org/sign-in) to obtain an API key.
